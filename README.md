# LEOdecayCalculator
 Low Earth orbiting satellites experience orbital decay and have physical lifetimes determined almost entirely by their interaction with the atmosphere. Prediction of such lifetimes or of a re-entry date is of great interest to satellite planners, users, trackers, and frequently to the general public.

This code uses an aproximation of a high altitude atmospherical Model to predict the drag, and thus the decay rate of objects orbiting the earth. (Valid for Orbits less than 500KM)
